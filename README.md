# :chart: Toy_Banking_App :moneybag:

I created this app as part of my CPSC 233 assignments, where I iteratively develop a desktop banking app using Java. Creating this simple app solidified my understanding of object oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, overriding and overloading.
Although some parts of this assignment are to be submitted as a team, everyone was required to create their own versions of the iterations, so all the code here is my own.
